# URL Shortener: Current Project Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The URL shortener service follows a clean, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. The application is built as an async-first system using FastAPI for the web framework and SQLModel (built on SQLAlchemy) for database operations.

### System Layers

The system is structured into four primary layers:

1. **Data Layer**: 
   - SQLModel entities with optimized indexes
   - Relationship definitions to ensure efficient database access patterns
   - Schema design optimized for URL shortening operations

2. **Repository Layer**: 
   - Abstracts all database operations through repository classes
   - Handles data access concerns and query optimization
   - Implements specialized query patterns like keyset pagination and bulk operations
   - Maximizes performance through strategic query design

3. **Service Layer**: 
   - Encapsulates all business logic
   - Orchestrates operations across repositories
   - Handles domain-specific operations:
     - URL shortening
     - URL redirection
     - Analytics processing
     - Caching strategies

4. **API Layer**: 
   - Lightweight FastAPI endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Delegation to appropriate service methods
   - Response transformation and formatting

## Technical Implementations

### Database Optimization

* Connection pooling to efficiently reuse database connections
* Strategic indexes on frequently accessed columns
* Optimized query patterns to avoid N+1 problems
* Atomic counter updates for click tracking
* Asynchronous database access throughout the codebase

### Resilience Patterns

* Comprehensive exception handling with domain-specific exceptions
* Circuit breaker implementation for database operations
* Redis-based rate limiting with memory fallback for high availability
* Graceful degradation when dependent services are unavailable

### Performance Considerations

* Non-blocking I/O operations throughout the codebase
* Background tasks for non-critical operations like click tracking
* Batch processing for high-volume operations
* Reduced lock contention in concurrent scenarios

### Observability

* Structured logging with context enrichment
* Non-blocking logging implementation
* Health check endpoints for system status monitoring

### Development Tooling

* Makefile with standardized commands for development workflow:
   * Environment setup and dependency management
   * Application startup with different configurations
   * Database migration handling
   * Local environment management
   * Docker image building and container orchestration

### Deployment Configuration

* Docker and Docker Compose setup for consistent environments
* Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
* Database migration handling with Alembic
* Proper startup/shutdown sequences

## Scalability Foundation

This architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling while maintaining code quality and performance. The system is designed to be horizontally scalable with minimal changes required to operate across multiple instances.

Key scaling enablers in the current design:
- Service-based architecture allows for independent scaling
- Stateless application design principles
- Externalized state management (database, Redis)
- Optimized resource utilization
- Resilience patterns for graceful degradation
